# An Embellished Goat Path Git Lesson
This is a git lesson built in part from the 'The Goat Path Git Lesson' (https://github.com/UA-Carpentries-Workshops/Goat_Path_Git_Lesson; Marnee Dearman, Blake Joyce, and Kristina Riemer) with additional content from other UA-carpentries git lessons by the same contributors.

Unlike in 'The Goat Path Git Lesson', I have elected to keep the README as a reference for potential future instructors. Individual mini-lessons can be found in the 'lessons' directory.

A note to future instructors: this git lesson plan was designed to be centered around the command line. GitHub, remote repositories, and the concepts of forking/cloning are saved until the very end, rather than being introduced at the beginning.

## Lesson Plan / Outline (Oct 2019, UA carpentry workshop)
1. What is Git?
2. Gitting started
3. Gitting things done
4. Working with remote repositories
