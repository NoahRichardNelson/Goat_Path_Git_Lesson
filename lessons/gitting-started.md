# Gitting started
We need to make sure both *git* and *GitHub* are set up for use!

## Make sure you have a GitHub account and can log into it!
If you have not yet created a GitHub account, please do so now! [github.com](https://github.com)

Pay attention to your *user email* for GitHub. You will need it later :grin:
It is recommended that you *use your UA email*, but it is not necessary.

## Make sure you have git installed on your computer!
To check if you have (the right version of) git installed, open a command line and do:

`git --version`

You should get an output like this (Any 2.XX.X version should be fine):

`git version 2.23.0`

If you get the following error message...

`bash: git: command not found`

...you need to install git! [Visit the workshop homepage here to find the git installation instructions](https://ua-carpentries-workshops.github.io/2019-10-26-Tucson/).

## Green stickies when ready, red if you need help!
