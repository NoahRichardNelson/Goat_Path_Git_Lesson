# Gitting started

## Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, we will:
- verify our GitHub accounts
- verify our install of Git
- configure Git on our computers

## Commands to be Covered
- `git --version` -- Ask Git what version it is. Also useful for verifying that you have Git installed.
- `git config --global <property key> "property value"` -- Add a property to your global Git configuration file. Git uses this file to determine who you are, communicate with GitHub (or other Git resources), and remember your settings for using Git.

## Make sure you have a GitHub account and can log into it!
If you have not yet created a GitHub account, please do so now! [github.com](https://github.com)

Pay attention to your *user email* for GitHub. You will need it later :grin:

It is recommended that you *use your UA email*, but it is not necessary.

## Make sure you have Git installed on your computer!
To check if you have (the right version of) git installed, open a command line and do:

```bash
git --version
```

You should get an output like this (Any 2.XX.X version should be fine):

```text
git version 2.23.0
```

If you get the following error message...

```text
bash: git: command not found
```

...you need to install git! [Visit the workshop homepage here to find the git installation instructions](https://ua-carpentries-workshops.github.io/2019-10-26-Tucson/).
