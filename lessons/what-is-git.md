# What is Git?
Git is a tool for "version control" (alt. "revision control", "versioning").

## What is "version control?"
We've all had this happen before. Researchers do this file naming thing. All. The. Time.

We do it so we can track the changes we make, collaborate with other researchers, and revisit old versions of our files. But there's a better way!

So let's set down some functional requirements for version control needed by researchers even if they don't know how to code quite yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Functional requirements of version control for researchers

1. Make it possible to *track changes* to documents, code, data, etc. *over time*
- Tracking changes (and being able to revisit past versions of files) is fundamental to version control
- "Make it possible" means that the tool must be simple
- Let researchers grow into using other aspects of the tool (git) to solve other versioning needs. These will naturally arise as researchers continue to use the tool (git). And there are few things in this world researchers are better at than, you know, researching how to fix a problem. They just need to know where to start!

This is a hammer that you can use to drive a nail (the task of interest) at nearly any skill level. This is what we are shooting for in this lesson.

This is what git gives you out of the box. Each of those tools are probably very useful, but it's so confusing as to be useless until you know how to use each, and every, one of those attachments. We ain't using this hammer here. Because it's confusing. And confusing is worthless for beginners needing to get something done.

2. Make it easier for researchers to *publish*, *collaborate*, and *share*
- Publish not just papers but code and (when possible) data
- Collaborate with others
- Make your work available to the *entire* world so that others can use it, build on it, repeat it, and many other things to increase human knowledge
- Underline collaborate in your mind. *Go on meow, underline it*.

The ability to publish, collaborate, and share is where resources like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and others come in. These are places to publish content online (code, data, drafts of papers, etc.) that are built around using version control software like Git to manage that content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## So...what is Git?
Git is powerful software to help you with version control and collaboration. That is, git helps you to track changes to your files over time, revisit prior versions of files, and collaborate with others. Git is built for the command line (although it can be managed to a degree through GUIs).

GitHub (and other such platforms) is an online place to facilitate that collaboration and publication of your work in accordance with the ideals of "open science".

## The Goat Path
This git lesson for researchers is based on the "Goat Path" concept. The Oxford definition of goat path is: A (narrow) path or track, especially on a hillside or mountain, such as is made by goats. Here we take a narrow path in describing git that is useful for researchers who need versioning in their day-to-day professional lives.

Why a goat path? Well a goat path can be the shortest (and possibly the safest) path to follow in a remote place you're not familiar with; this is exactly how researchers learning code often feel about versioning technologies. The beauty of a goat path is that something (quite possibly actual goats) has followed that specific path so many times it's actually cut a visible and easy to follow trail. If it wasn't safe, it's very likely the path wouldn't get cut in the first place, because those things wouldn't be able to retread their path over and over again.

In case you've never seen a goat path before: this is one.

If you don't follow the goat path as a beginner, bad things happen sometimes. This is so common with git that the popular comic XKCD has even commented on it.

***Please note:*** there has been no mention of coding above. That's on purpose; git can be used to perform version control on regular text (manuscripts, dissertations, theses, etc), data (though there are many, many other [probably better] ways to do this), as well as code! Versioning is great. And versioning is really the whole point here. Git just happens to be the tool we use (but there are many other options, go explore!).
