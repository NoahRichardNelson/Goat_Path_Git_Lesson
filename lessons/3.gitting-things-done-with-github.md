## Why use remote repositories?
As we discussed previously, you can "Git things done" using only a local repository. So why use a remote repository at all?

There are 2 main reasons to use a remote repository:
1. Collaboration
  - work on the same files as your collaborators, using Git to keep track of everyone's contributions
  - let others know exactly what you've been contributing
2. Confidence
  - the remote repo can serve as a backup on the cloud
  - GitHub (for example) is popular enough that they have to take very good care of their servers

In addition, online platforms like GitHub provide some nice GUIs for interacting with your repo and viewing your commit history.
