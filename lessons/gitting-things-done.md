# Terminological Reference

**to commit (v.)** -- to save the state of all of your files in the repository.

_I committed the changes to the repository._

**commit (n.)** -- an individual instance of a committing event. A snapshot of the repository in time.

_The last commit introduced a bug in the program._

**changeset** -- a set of changes which should be treated as an indivisible group.

**index** -- this is a list of all commits.

**to stage (v.)** -- to bundle files together *in preparation* of a commit (i.e., saving the state to the repo).

**staging area (n.)** -- the digital "space" where staging takes place. Changes must first be added to the staging area before you can commit them.
